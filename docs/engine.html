<p>
AudioKit relies on a world-class core audio engine called <a href="http://csound.github.io/">Csound</a>.  We chose Csound for a variety of reasons which we outline below.
</p>

<table><thead><th>Property</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>

<tr>

<p>What AudioKit provides on top of all this is a simple, human-readable interface to Csound's functionality within the familiar programming environment of Xcode and developing in Objective-C or Swift with integrated documentation and code-completion.  You can easily tie your app's logic to sound or music parameters for instance.  Additionally, you can use all of the modern features of these languages to govern audio events and sequences.</p>
