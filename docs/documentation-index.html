<p>Hierarchically, the structure of an Audio Kit program usually looks like this:</p>

<div class="hide-on-mobiles">
<ul>
  <li><a href="/core-classes/">Manager</a> - which manages the sound <a href="/engine/">engine</a> and the creation of the...</li>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/core-classes/">Orchestra</a> - which is a collection of...</li>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/core-classes/">Instruments</a> - which has a series of interconnected</li>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/operations">Operations</a> - each of which is controlled by their own...</li>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/parameters/">Parameters</a> - which can be audio streams, control signals, or constants and be defined to be...</li>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="/properties/">Properties</a> - of either the instrument or the notes the instrument produces.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="show-on-mobiles">
<ul>
  <li><a href="/core-classes/">Manager</a> - which manages the sound <a href="/engine/">engine</a> and the creation of the...</li>
  <li><a href="/core-classes/">Orchestra</a> - which is a collection of...</li>
  <li><a href="/core-classes/">Instruments</a> - which has a series of interconnected</li>
  <li><a href="/operations">Operations</a> - each of which is controlled by their own...</li>
  <li><a href="/parameters/">Parameters</a> - which can be audio streams, control signals, or constants and be defined to be...</li>
  <li><a href="/properties/">Properties</a> - of either the instrument or the notes the instrument produces.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Instruments can also create notes which are controllable objects in their own right, following this flow:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/core-classes/">Instruments</a> can spawn instances of...
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/core-classes/">Notes</a> - each of which can have their own independent...
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/properties/">Properties</a> - which define duration and local variations to the instrument's operations.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
