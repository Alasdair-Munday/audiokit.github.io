<h3 id="faq-1"><strong>Q.</strong>
Is AudioKit just Csound with a better front end?
</h3>

<p>
This is like asking if Apple OSX just FreeBSD with a better front-end.  You could look at it that way, but the front-end is what really matters when you're developing sounds for use in applications, which is what AudioKit excels at. Yes, it uses Csound as the audio engine, but the real power of AudioKit is the way that you can easily integrate audio into native iOS and OSX applications.
</p>

<h3 id="faq-2"><strong>Q.</strong>
Can I run Csound files inside iOS or OSX using AudioKit?
</h3>

<p>
No, but you can encapsulate Csound into user-defined opcodes which can be used as operations within AudioKit. However, we don't encourage this, as you're really not leveraging the full power of AudioKit by doing so.
</p>

<h3 id="faq-3"><strong>Q.</strong>
What is AudioKit's license?
</h3>

<p>
AudioKit is offered under the <a href="https://github.com/audiokit/AudioKit/blob/develop/LICENSE">LGPL License</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="faq-4"><strong>Q.</strong>
What are the implications of the LGPL License for using AudioKit for AppStore Apps?
</h3>

<p>
Your code outside of AudioKit does not have to be open-sourced. You can use AudioKit to develop your closed source project for distribution on the AppStore.  The only request we have is that if you make updates to AudioKit, you offer them to the rest of the open source community by having a fork of your version of AudioKit available on Github, and if the improvements are good for everyone, you submit a pull request with your changes.

<h3 id="faq-5"><strong>Q.</strong>
Is there an (Android/JavaScript/Xamarin) version on the way?
</h3>

<p>
We've had many questions come in asking if an Android, Javascript, or Xamarin (C#) version is on the way. At the moment, we've been focused on making AudioKit the best possible tool to develop audio-related apps on iOS and OSX. As such, we haven't yet had time to start developing versions of AudioKit for these other platforms.
</p>

<p>
That being said, we are extremely eager to get to work on them. But we need your help. If you're interested in helping develop AudioKit for Android, Javascript, or Xamarin, please <a href="mailto:audiokit@audiokit.io">get in touch</a> if you would be interested in contributing!. We look forward to working with you.

<h3 id="faq-6"><strong>Q.</strong>
What if my question isn't on here?
</h3>

If you have a question that isn't listed on here, then a member of the <a href="groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/audiokit">AudioKit Google Group</a> may be able to help. Additionally, we'd be happy to have a code review with you on <a href="screenhero.com">Screenhero</a>.
