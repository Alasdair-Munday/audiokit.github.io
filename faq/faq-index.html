    <h3>Some of your Questions:</h3>
</div>

<div class="col_half nobottommargin">

<h3 id="faq-1"><strong>Q.</strong>
Why is my app giving me a prompt to use the microphone?
</h3>

<p>
AudioKit defaults to allowing your apps to use have microphone access. You can disable microphone access by going to the AudioKit.plist file in the Resources group in Xcode, and setting the "Enable Audio Input By Default" flag to "NO".
</p>

<h3 id="faq-2"><strong>Q.</strong>
Is AudioKit just Csound with a better front end?
</h3>

<p>
This is like asking if Apple OSX just FreeBSD with a better front-end.  You could look at it that way, but the front-end is what really matters when you're developing sounds for use in applications, which is what AudioKit excels at. Yes, it uses Csound as the audio engine, but the real power of AudioKit is the way that you can easily integrate audio into native iOS and OSX applications.
</p>

<h3 id="faq-3"><strong>Q.</strong>
Can I run Csound files inside iOS or OSX using AudioKit?
</h3>

<p>
No, but you can encapsulate Csound into user-defined opcodes which can be used as operations within AudioKit. However, we don't encourage this, as you're really not leveraging the full power of AudioKit by doing so.
</p>

<h3 id="faq-4"><strong>Q.</strong>
What is AudioKit's license?
</h3>

<p>
AudioKit is offered under the <a href="https://github.com/audiokit/AudioKit/blob/develop/LICENSE">MIT License</a>.  Some of AudioKit's dependencies (libsndfile) are LGPL, so these dependencies are dynamically linked.  This is fine for your OSX projects, but it does limit you to using iOS8 and newer, to be strictly compliant.  That being said, plenty of Csound-powered apps in the Apple App Store statically link LGPL libraries and it hasn't been an issue.
</p>

<h3 id="faq-5"><strong>Q.</strong>
Is AudioKit CPU or memory intensive?
</h3>

<p>
We have not found AudioKit to be very CPU or memory intensive during application testing and development. However, you may notice a spike in CPU usage if you are using a relatively high number of instruments. This may typically happen if you have accidentally allocated a new instrument for every individual note in a phrase.

<p>
Playgrounds, however, are rather CPU intensive. Playgrounds are only used for audio prototyping, not for deployment, so you don't need to worry if you experience heavy CPU usage while using Playgrounds.
</p>

<h3 id="faq-6"><strong>Q.</strong>
"Can I use Ogg Vorbis or FLAC format files with AudioKit?"
</h3>

<p>
You can on OS X apps, but not iOS apps. The reason for this is that we're using a compiled version of libsndfile that already supports Ogg Vorbis or FLAC files on the Mac side, but not for iOS.
</p>

<p>
Since iOS apps are much more resource constrained than OS X apps, we thought it best not to include another dependency in the AudioKit framework to support these edge cases.
</p>

<p>
Playgrounds, however, are rather CPU intensive. Playgrounds are only used for audio protoyping, not for deployment, so you don't need to worry if you experience heavy CPU useage while using Playgrounds.
</p>

<h3 id="faq-7"><strong>Q.</strong>
The example projects built, but the apps didn't launch. What's wrong?
</h3>

<p>
Chances are, the default target is set to either the AudioKit dynamic or static libraries. Change the target to the app that you're trying to launch, and then run again.
</p>

<h3 id="faq-8"><strong>Q.</strong>
Is there an (Android/JavaScript/Xamarin) version on the way?
</h3>

<p>
We've had many questions come in asking if an Android, Javascript, or Xamarin (C#) version is on the way. At the moment, we've been focused on making AudioKit the best possible tool to develop audio-related apps on iOS and OSX. As such, we haven't yet had time to start developing versions of AudioKit for these other platforms.
</p>

<p>
That being said, we are extremely eager to get to work on them. But we need your help. If you're interested in helping develop AudioKit for Android, Javascript, or Xamarin, please <a href="mailto:audiokit@audiokit.io">get in touch</a> if you would be interested in contributing! We look forward to working with you.
</p>


<h3 id="faq-9"><strong>Q.</strong>
What if my question isn't on here?
</h3>

<p>
If you have a question that isn't listed on here, then a member of the <a href="http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/audiokit">AudioKit Google Group</a> may be able to help. Additionally, we'd be happy to have a code review with you on <a href="http://screenhero.com">Screenhero</a>.
