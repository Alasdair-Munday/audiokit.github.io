<h3 id="faq-1"><strong>Q.</strong>
Can I use AudioKit on Android?
</h3>

<p>
Not yet, but we are extremely interested in making that happen. If you're interested in developing AudioKit for Android, please get in touch either at <a href="mailto:audiokit@audiokit.io">audiokit@audiokit.io</a>, or at the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/audiokit">Google Group</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="faq-2"><strong>Q.</strong>
Is AudioKit just Csound with a better front end?
</h3>

<p>
This is like asking if Apple OSX just FreeBSD with a better front-end.  You could look at it that way, but the front-end is what really matters when you're developing sounds for use in applications, which is what AudioKit excels at. Yes, it uses Csound as the audio engine, but the real power of AudioKit is the way that you can easily integrate audio into native iOS and OSX applications.
</p>

<h3 id="faq-3"><strong>Q.</strong>
Can I run Csound files inside iOS or OSX using AudioKit?
</h3>

<p>
No, but you can encapsulate Csound into user-defined opcodes which can be used as operations within AudioKit. However, we don't encourage this, as you're really not leveraging the full power of AudioKit by doing so.
</p>

<h3 id="faq-4"><strong>Q.</strong>
What is AudioKit's license?
</h3>

<p>
AudioKit is offered under the <a href="https://github.com/audiokit/AudioKit/blob/develop/LICENSE">LGPL License</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="faq-5"><strong>Q.</strong>
What are the implications of the LGPL License for using AudioKit for AppStore Apps?
</h3>

<p>
Your code outside of AudioKit does not have to be open-sourced. You can use AudioKit to develop your closed source project for distribution on the AppStore.  The only request we have is that if you make updates to AudioKit, you offer them to the rest of the open source community by having a fork of your version of AudioKit available on Github, and if the improvements are good for everyone, you submit a pull request with your changes.
</p>

<h3 id="faq-6"><strong>Q.</strong>
What if my question isn't on here?
</h3>

<p>
If you have a question that isn't listed on here, then a member of the <a href="groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/audiokit">AudioKit Google Group</a> may be able to help. Additionally, we'd be happy to have a code review with you on <a href="screenhero.com">Screenhero</a>.
