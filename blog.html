<h3>Happy New Year Everyone!</h3>

<p>Just wanted to take this opportunity to give everyone a sneak peek into what's happening with AudioKit and what our plans are for the new year.</p>

<p>In the first half of January we'll be releasing AudioKit version 1.2.
This release continues with the trend of adding sensible defaults and tests for every operation as well as improving the example projects.</p>

<p>After that we're hoping to be concentrating on projects that highlight AudioKit.
These projects will cover a variety of use cases and of course the code will be open sourced and we'll try to write tutorials from the experience as well.</p>

<p>Of course along the way AudioKit will evolve and we already have ideas for what V1.3 will bring.
Thanks to feedback from people on Twitter and Google we have our eyes towards building an Android version and integrating with inter-app audio technologies such as Audiobus and VST/AU Plugins.
</p>

<p>
Most of all, we definitely want the theme of 2015 to be creativity and fun.  Being able to create and manipulate audio quickly using AudioKit should allow us to concentrate on other parts of the app to create really compelling interactive audio experiences.
</p>

<p>Finally, any app created using AudioKit will be considered "one of our own" meaning that we will help you work through issues and highlight/promote all apps on AudioKit.io and through our social media outlets.</p>

<p>
So, here's to an exciting new year, glad to have you on board.

<h3>What we've been up to</h3>
<p>
It's been about a month since we first released AudioKit, and we've been busy the entire time. AudioKit was featured on HackerNews and showcased on GitHub, leading to over 570 Stargazers, 51 forks, and 34 watchers.
</p>

<p>
We competed in the first ever AppleWatch Hackathon; winning the <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2014/12/03/in-worlds-first-apple-watch-hackathon-apps.html?ana=twt">award for best design</a>. The judges stated the award was given not only for graphic design, but overall design which includes sound design and application design. We plan on having source code and a tutorial up for you all soon.
</p>


<h3>Version 1.1!</h3>
<p>
But the biggest news we have is that version 1.1 is now released! A lot of progress was made in ensuring that not only do the Mac examples work out-of-the-box, but also, now when you create your applications, they will work without requiring an installer.  We've writt
ure your application to use AudioKit</a>.
</p>

<h3>Sensible Defaults and Tests</h3>
<p>
We've also made improvements to every Physical Model operation, as well beginning the process of what we call <a href="/features/#sensible_defaults">Sensible Defaults</a>. Previously, when you created an instance of an object, you had to define all the values of the parameters in the initialization function. Sensible Defaults give you the option to create an instance of an AudioKit object already initalized with parameter values that will let you hear a sound right away.
</p>

<p>
We've also open-sourced the internal tests we've been making to generate sensible defaults. So far, we have tests and sensible defaults for 23 operations. As we generate more tests, we'll add them to the repository.
</p>

<h3>AKPhrase</h3>
<p>
We have a new object too, <a href="/core-classes/">AKPhrase</a>.  An AKPhrase is a simpler version of AKSequence that only contains notes and start times.  This allows you create musical events easily when you don't need to harness the full power of AKSequence.
</p>

<h3>File templates</h3>
<p>
Additionally, we've made some <a href="/tutorials/xcode/">Xcode file templates</a> so you can get started with your project faster. There are templates for a Conductor, an Instrument, and a Processor; in both Objective-C and Swift.
</p>

<h3>AudioKit Forum</h3>
<p>
Finally, we've set up a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/audiokit">Google group</a> for AudioKit users. Feel free to post if you have any questions or need some help with anything!
</p>

<p>
Happy programming!
</p>
