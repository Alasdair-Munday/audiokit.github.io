You can either follow along step by step, or take a look at the completed example project here: <a href="https://github.com/audiokit/FirstInstrumentTutorial">FirstInstrumentTutorial Project</a>.

Setting up a project with AudioKit is extremely easy. After you’ve created a new project in Xcode, navigate to your AudioKit repository. Then, drag the folder that says “AudioKit” into your project.

</p>

<p>
After you do this, you’ll see a screen that will ask you to choose some options for adding the files. If you're just experiementing with AudioKit for now, you can leave "Copy items if needed" unchecked. If you're making an app that will be sold on the App Store, then you'll want to make sure "Copy items if needed" is checked.

Then, click Finish.
</p>

<p>
After you’ve finished, you’ll see a folder on the left side of Xcode with AudioKit.

The last thing we need to do is delete the libraries that we won't be using for this project. Open up the AudioKit folder, you'll see a folder that says "Platforms" as shown below.
</p>

<p>
Since we're making an iOS project that uses Objective-C, we need to delete the OSX and Swift folders. Make sure you click "Delete references", and not "Delete items". When you're finished, your library folder will look like the one shown below:

<p>Now we'll show you how to make your first AudioKit instrument!</p>
