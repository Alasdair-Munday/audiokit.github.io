We’re really excited that you want to contribute to AudioKit! To help you get started, we’ve made this guide for contributing.
</p>

<p>
First, you're going to want to fork a copy of the AudioKit repository to your own GitHub account. To do this, click on the “Fork” button in the top right corner of the repository page.

</p>


<p>
Next, you need to clone your forked repository to your computer. You can do this either though the terminal, or through a Git front-end, such as SourceTree. The screenshots below are from SourceTree.
</p>

<p>
To add specific features, make a branch off your repository to test your ideas. Make sure you name your branch something descriptive so you can keep track of your work; this is especially important if you are working with multiple branches at once.
</p>

<p>
After you’ve finished working on your branch, commit and push your changes.
</p>

</p>

<p>
When your pull request has been approved, you'll see a notifcation in GitHub. At that point, change back to your main branch.

<p>
Then, delete the branch you were working on your changes in.
</p>

Finally, pull your changes from the develop branch. Make sure that you pull from “upstream”.
