<p>
Follow the configuration instructions for an Objective-C project and then there will be one additional step we need to make in order to use AudioKit in our Swift project. One of the great things about Swift is that we're able to easily use Objective-C code in Swift projects. In order for AudioKit to be exposed to our Swift project, we need to make a Bridging-Header file.
</p>

<p>
Make a new file (command-N), and select "Header File". Name the file "SwiftProject-Bridging-Header.h"Make sure you have "SwiftProject" selected under Targets.

</p>

<p>There's some default text in the bridging header file (shown below) that you can go ahead and delete that.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
#ifndef SwiftProject_SwiftProject_Bridging_Header_h
#define SwiftProject_SwiftProject_Bridging_Header_h

#endif
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
Then, add the following import statements to the bridging header. These will allow our project to access all of the features of AKFoundation and AKTools.
</p>

{% highlight objective-c %}
#import "AKFoundation.h"
#import "AKTools.h"
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Next, go to your target's build settings. Click on "SwiftProject" under "Targets".</p>

</p>

<p>Navigate to the build settings</p>

<p>
<img src=/tutorials/buildSettings.png style="width:100%; max-width:567px" alt="Build Settings">
</p>

<p>Search for "bridging header" in the search bar. You should see "Objective-C Bridging Header" underneath "Swift Compiler - Code Generation".

<p>

</p>

<p>Double click on the that line. A white box will pop up that will let you enter in some text. Add "SwiftProject-BridgingHeader.h".
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Hit Enter, and your screen should look like the one below.

</p>

<p>
Now that our Swift project is able to "see" AudioKit, we can go ahead and start making our first instrument in Swift!"
