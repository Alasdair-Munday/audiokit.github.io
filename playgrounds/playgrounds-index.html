<h3>Playgrounds will rock your world</h3>

<p>
Playgrounds are a means to develop audio applications with immediate aural and visual feedback about what you are creating.  Gone are the days of write-compile-listen-and-rewrite.  Not only can you develop quickly, but you can stumble upon amazing sounds along the way.  Truly, you're learning to play an instrument, and that instrument is AudioKit code.  As you can tell, we're super excited about how this will help developers create amazing things.

<h3>The <code>Playground.m</code> file</h3>

<p>This will be your main workspace while developing playgrounds (though you can import other classes too).  There are two methods that need to be implemented:

<h4><code>setup</code> method</h4>

<p>This method run exactly once when the playground is first run.  You can add instruments here if you know they will not need to be changed during the run.  You can also setup standard UI elements here.</p>

<h4><code>run</code> method</h4>

<p>This method is run every time and will be where you do your experimenting.  A couple of things to be careful about are to make sure you declare instruments with a number tag using "instrumentWithNumber" or "initWithNumber" so that the instrument is replaced on each run.  Also, instead of "play"ing instrument, you will want to "restart" it so that any previous sounds that had been started are stopped rather than layered onto one another.</p>

<h3>Playground helper methods</h3>

<h3>Installation Instructions</h3>

<p>Playgrounds require a couple of programs to be installed on your computer in addition to AudioKit.  We have built an installation script so all you have to do is go into the Playgrounds folder and run <code>install.sh</code>:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd Playgrounds
$ ./install.sh
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This will install the Xcode <a href="https://github.com/dyci/dyci-main">Dynamic Code Injection plugin</a> and the GEM for a file-change watcher called <a href="https://github.com/alloy/kicker">Kicker</a>.</p>

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> If you update Xcode at all, you'll need to run the installation script again so that the Dynamic Code Injection plugin and Kicker are reinstalled.
</p>

<h3>Running a Playground</h3>

<p>The best way to run the playground is to use the included <code>run.sh</code> script. This will start an interactive bash session asking you what you would like to do.  On your first run you will want to choose option 3 and install one of the default playgrounds.  In the future when you're developing, you will want to run with option 1, the current playground.  Be careful not to accidentally trash your existing playground by installing a default on top of it!</p>

{% highlight bash %}
┌─ ~/Developer/AudioKit/Playgrounds
└─➤ ./run.sh
1) Run Current Playground 3) Choose Playground from List
2) Run Empty Playground
Enter your choice: 3

1) BambooSticks        6) Oscillator    11) Table
2) Default             7) PluckedString 12) Tambourine
3) Mandolin            8) Sequencing    13) VCOscillator
4) Marimba             9) Sleighbells   14) Vibraphone
5) MicrophoneAnalysis 10) StruckMetalBar
Enter the number of the playground you want:
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Setting up a playground from scratch</h3>

<ol>
<li>Install cocoapods if you haven't already</li>
<li>Create a new iOS project for your playground</li>
<li>Close the project, and from the project folder, run <code>pod init</code></li>
<li>Edit the podfile to include KZPlayground like in the AudioKitPlayground project</li>
<li>Run <code>kicker -sql 0.05 YourProjectFolder</code> replacing <code>YourProjectFolder</code> with folder containing your watched classes</li>
<li>Create a new playground class that is a subclass of <code>AKPlayground</code></li>
<li>Edit the playground class's header file:
{% highlight objective-c %}
#import "AKPlayground.h"

@interface Playground : AKPlayground <KZPActivePlayground>

@end
{% endhighlight %}
</li>
<li>Create the <code>setup</code> and <code>run</code> methods in the implementation file.</li>
</ol>
