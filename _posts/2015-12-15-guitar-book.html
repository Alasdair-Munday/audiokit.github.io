<p>Joachim Sendelbach has just released his AudioKit-power app "Guitar Book" to the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lb/app/guitar-book-lite-learning/id1047579744?mt=8">App Store</a>!  Here's how he describes the app:
 </p>
 <hr>
 <p>
Learn guitar on your real instrument using your device's microphone!
</p>
<p>
Guitar Book is the ultimative new method for learning guitar! Learn songs with real music notation. The order of the pieces is especially arranged for beginners, so you will progress from one tune to another without any trouble. You will be coached by the automatic training program. You play the songs on your real instrument, Guitar Book will analyze how you play and show you the result. You can see your performance of each line in the piece and how many notes you missed.
<p>
Automatic Coach leads you to success with only a few exercises. First you try the notes without rhythm detection, afterwards you practice with metronome and finally you play the song with a complete playback. Training mode waits for you, concert mode runs with playback and plays the song continuously. Tap on a position in the song sheet and Guitar Book will start from that bar. Press long on a bar to repeat a whole line. Activate fretboard screen in the navigation bar if you don't know a note in the piece. Of course there are also video tutorials included which help you to learn new techniques.
