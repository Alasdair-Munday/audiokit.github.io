<p>Aure's two teams, "Pow!" and "AirDrum", won and got honorable mention at the 2015 Apple Watch Hackathon.  Pair programming with Brian Jordan, Aure created both apps from the same code base, powered by AudioKit, and just took slightly different takes at the same problem.  It was quite a challenge to learn WatchOS2, WCSession stuff, and make compelling apps in one afternoon!</p>
