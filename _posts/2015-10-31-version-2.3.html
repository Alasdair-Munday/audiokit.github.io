<p>Version 2.3 keeps AudioKit up-to-date with Xcode7, Swift2, iOS9 and adds tvOS support</p>

<h4>tvOS Support</h4>

<p>You can write audio apps for the AppleTV with AudioKit as easily as you could for iOS and OSX.  There is an included HelloWorld example to help get you started.</p>

<h4>Xcode7, Swift2, and iOS9 Updates</h4>

<p>The internals of AudioKit were updated to take advantage of new features such as generics, null specifiers, etc.

<h4>New operations</h4>

<p>Daniel Clelland was busy improving AudioKit's FFT library with the new AKFilteredFFT, AKMaskedFFT, AKTableReader, and AKTableWriter operations.</p>

<p>There is also a beat clock implementation in AKBeatClock that can be used to write looper apps as well as a new AKCompressorExpander that is a bit more intuitive than the powerful yet a bit cumbersome AKCompressor.  </p>
