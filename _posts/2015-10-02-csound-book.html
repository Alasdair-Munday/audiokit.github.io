    Pretty much have to file this under the "huh?" category.  Looks like AudioKit will have a chapter in Richard Boulanger's new book about "Csound Applied / Csound Inside".  Pretty awesome to have a book chapter written about our little toolkit.  It's just weird that Richard is having his son write the chapter and ignores the fact that Nick Arner and Stephane Peter have both put a heck of a lot more work in to AudioKit in the years since Richard's son was involved.  Nick has not only written a the iOS chapter of the Csound FLOSS Manual, but a ton of AudioKit tutorials, so he would have been the non-nepotistic choice.  Sigh.  I love my son too, just hope I don't have to baby him all the way up to when he's got kids of his own.
