    The 3rd International Csound Conference was this weekend and Richard Boulanger announed that a new Csound Book is in the works called "Csound Applied / Csound Inside" and that there will be a chapter dedicated to AudioKit in it.  Pretty awesome to have a book chapter written about our little audio toolkit.  We would like to encourage Richard to take a second look at the proposed table of contents however.  Instead of teaching the reader about basic programming concepts like the MVC pattern and how to translate Csound to AudioKit, we suggest a tutorial that follows preferred AudioKit best-practices.  We're really looking forward to Rory Walsh's and Paul Batchelor's chapters though. Those at least, look excellent.
