<p>Matthew Fecher and I just released the Analog Synth X on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1076476110&mt=8">App Store</a>!
 </p>
<p>
The source code for this app comes with AudioKit of course, in the Examples/iOS Folder.  We plan to make udpates to this app over time, have some tutorials, and also release more apps.  AudioKit3 makes it pretty easy!
