On Saturday April 18th, Aure will be at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/CocoaPods-SF/events/220783749/">San Francisco location</a> 
for the <a href="http://blog.cocoapods.org/Test-Jammin/">CocoaPods Testing Jam</a>, working on adding test support for AudioKit. We recently found out that the <a href="http://cocoapods.org/pods/AudioKit">AudioKit pod</a> is one of the top 200 most popular CocoaPods, which is why the folks at CocoaPods have included it in this latest Test Jam!

You can check out our <a href="http://blog.cocoapods.org/Test-Jammin/">GitHub issue</a> to read more about what we hope to accomplish. 
We're extremely excited at this chance to further improve AudioKit, and we're incredibly grateful that AudioKit has reached such a level of popularity. Thank you for your support, and be sure to let <a href="mailto:aure@audiokit.io">Aure</a>know if you're going to be participating in the Test Jam!
