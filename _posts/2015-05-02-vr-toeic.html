<p>I just learned that Keunwoo Choi has just released his AudioKit-power app "VR TOEIC" to the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=975407337">App Store</a>!  Keunwoo Choi uses AudioKit in this app to process the audio lessons for the "Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC)".  I've tried his app and it is remarkable how much more realistic the normally bland, mono audio feels and you get an amazingly convincing sensation that the speaker is "right there to my left" or "slighly behind me to the right" depending on the settings you chooose.  He is using AKConvolution and heard-related impulse response files to create a really great sound. </p>

<p>Congratulations Keunwoo!</p>
