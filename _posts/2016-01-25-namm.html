<p>
NAMM 2016 is over and it was a whirlwind four days!  We introduced hundreds of people and companies to AudioKit, demonstrated the SwiftSynth and a few apps still under development, and in general had a great time.
</p>

<p>
Four of us from the core team were there, in the photo from left to right: Stephane, Paul, Aure, and Jeff.  The core team has quadrupled in size since last year so maybe next year we'll see 16 people at NAMM?  I'll still buy everybody lunch even at that size!

<p>
The things that people were most impressed with were how quickly we were able to create SwiftSynth and the teaching potential of AudioKit playgrounds.
</p>

<p>
For next year, it would be great if AudioKit team members were asked to appear as Panelists for the Tech Track talks.  With some notable exceptions, this year's tech talks were dominated by sales and marketing folk who didn't really understand technology at all.  That would be my one complaint about NAMM this year, lack of substance and information.
</p>

<p>
Also for next year, I want to be able to have a suite of apps to show that use AudioKit 3.  So, for all you app developers, let me remind you that core team is here to help you release that app.  Let us know how we can help!
