<p>Aure just got back from a trip down south to give guest lectures and an afternoon workshop at UC Irvine's COSMOS program.  It was for <a href="http://www.cosmos.uci.edu/cluster5.html">Cluster 5: Sound For Mobile Devices: Physical Modeling And Programming</a>.  He spent the morning discussing Human-Computer Interaction, live-coding AudioKit demos, and discussing what it's been like to run an open-source audio toolkit project.  The students had a lot of great discussions with Aure, offering ingenious answers to Aure's challenges and asking all the right questions of Aure as well!  It's a four week program and the students were starting their second week.  Each team's goal is to have an audio app by the end of the program, so we're really looking forward to see what they produce.

<p>Good luck everyone!</p>
