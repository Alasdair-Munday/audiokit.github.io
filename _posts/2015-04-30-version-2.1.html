<p>Version 2.1 is a very substantial improvement to AudioKit and it is recommended that all users upgrade.</p>

<h4>Dynamic Libraries and MIT License</h4>

<p>The big news is that we have enabled AudioKit and its dependencies to be dynamic libraries.
This allows us to license AudioKit under the liberal MIT License.  See the installation instructions for more information on choosing and configuring static vs. dynamic libraries.</p>

<p>Stéphane Peter really took charge of updating AudioKit to be a dynamic library and he's made so many contributions to AudioKit that he's earned the right to be a core team member.  Thank you Stéphane!</p>

<h4>Continuous Integration Testing</h4>

<p>We've started using TravisCI for continuous integration testing.  Travis runs tests on AudioKit whenever we update the code or whenever we receive a pull request from someone in the community suggesting a change.  If TravisCI gives us the green light, we can feel more confident making the proposed change.</p>

<h4>... and more!</h4>

<p>We've embedded all the utility instruments, plots, and tools into AudioKit, so in general all you ever have to import is <code>AKFoundation.h</code>.</p>

<p>There are some new operations and demos too.  We now have an <code>AKRingModulator</code> and an <code>AK3DBinauralAudio</code> operation which simulates 3D audio when you listen with headphones.  There is a new BinauralAudio example in the examples repository to demonstrate this efffect.  Also in this repository is the new TableDemo showing how to change tables on the fly.</p>

<p>Finally, rest assured that the web site has been heavily udpated for the new version, with new installation videos and tutorials.</p>
