<p>Version 2.1 is a very substantial improvement to AudioKit, and we recommend that all users upgrade.</p>

<h4>Dynamic Libraries and MIT License</h4>

<p>The big news is that we have enabled AudioKit and its dependencies to be dynamic libraries.
This allows us to license AudioKit under the liberal <a href="https://github.com/audiokit/AudioKit/blob/develop/LICENSE">MIT License</a>.  See the <a href="/tutorials/">installation instructions</a> for more information on choosing and configuring static vs. dynamic libraries.</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/megastep">Stéphane Peter</a> really took charge of updating AudioKit's dependencies to be dynamic libraries and he's made so many contributions to AudioKit that he's earned the right to be a core team member.  Thank you Stéphane!</p>

<h4>Continuous Integration Testing</h4>

<p>We've started using TravisCI for <a href="/tests/">continuous integration testing</a>.  Travis runs tests on AudioKit whenever we update the code or whenever we receive a pull request from someone in the community suggesting a change.  If TravisCI gives us the green light, we can feel more confident making the proposed change.</p>

<h4>... and more!</h4>

<p>We've embedded all the utility instruments, plots, and tools into AudioKit, so in general all you ever have to import is <code>AKFoundation.h</code>.</p>

<p>There are some new operations and demos too.  We now have an <a href="/Classes/AKRingModulator.html"><code>AKRingModulator</code></a> and an <a href="/Classes/AK3DBinauralAudio.html"><code>AK3DBinauralAudio</code></a> operation which simulates 3D audio when you listen with headphones.  There is a new <a href="/examples/BinauralAudio">BinauralAudio</a> example in the examples repository to demonstrate this efffect.  Also in this repository is the new <a href="/examples/TableDemo/">TableDemo</a> showing how to change tables on the fly.</p>

<p>Finally, rest assured that the web site has been heavily udpated for the new version, with new installation videos and tutorials.</p>
