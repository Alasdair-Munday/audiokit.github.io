<p>Joachim Sendelbach has just released his AudioKit-power app "Guitar Score Trainer" to the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/guitar-score-trainer-lite/id1008613919?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4">App Store</a>!
 </p>
<p>Many guitar players still think that reading guitar scores is particularly difficult. The "Guitar Score Trainer" will prove them wrong. The virtual fret board makes it very easy to learn the actual position of the note in the score. Seven well-structured levels will teach you all the notes in the first position.</p>

<p>There are three disciplines:</p>

<p>
1. Name the notes<br>
2. Learn the position on the fret board<br>
3. Play the notes on your own guitar using device's microphone<br>
 </p>

<p>Congratulations Joachim!</p>
