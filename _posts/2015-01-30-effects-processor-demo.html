title: Song Library Player is now the Effects Processor Demo
date: "2015-01-30"

<p>I've recently moved the Song Library Player example out of the Examples directory in AudioKit and into its own repository on Github:</p>

<p>Song Library Player was getting a bit too complex for a simple example folder project and we're going to make it even cooler and therefor a bit more complex.  The first change is that now instead of just having a reverb effect, there is also a Variable Delay and Moog Ladder filter.  These are chained effects so this project serves as a good example of chaining effects together.  We'll be adding more signal modifiers to the example so it will be a way to pull up an effect and hear what it does to songs from your library.</p>
