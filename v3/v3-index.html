<thead><th>Feature</th><th>V2.x</th><th>V3 Beta</th></tr></thead>

<tr>
<th>Live Coding with Playgrounds</th>
<td>35 Objective-C Playgrounds based off of KZPlayground are powerful but do require extending Xcode with dynamic code injection.</td>
<td>40+ Standard Xcode  Swift Playgrounds with some limitations such as less user interface control and no live-input processing on iOS and limited AKNode support on OSX.  Hopefully this will improve over time.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Graphing</th>
<td>Integrated EZAudio graphs of waveforms, FFT spectrum etc.  Pretty badass.</td>
<td>No graphing, yet.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Audio Operations</th>
<td>120</td>
<td>57 and counting</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Audio Engine</th>
<td>Csound</td>
<td>AVAudioEngine, Soundpipe, which includes code from Chuck, Csound, Faust, Guitarix, ToneStack.  Basically, if is open-sourced we can include it.  Email us!</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th><nobr>Integration with Other Audio Tools</nobr></th>
<td>Very little integration with other audio tools is possible.  Audio comes in from the microphone and out of the speakers and any audio has to come from the microphone, the file system, iTunes, or generated in AudioKit.</td>
<td>This version attempts to be a cooperative member of any audio ecosystem.  AudioKit's nodes are just Audio Units themselves, so they can be dropped in to a signal chain as you wish.  Any third party tool can be easily included in the signal chain as well.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Language</th>
<td>Written in Objective-C, but works just as well with a Swift-based app.</td>
<td>Written in Swift with C/C++ underpinnings.  Probably works fine with Objective-C, but we're focussing on Swift from now on.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Installation</th>
<td>Fairly easy installation as a static or dynamic library.  Dependencies include libCsound and libSndFile. CocoaPods Support.</td>
<td>Just drag the framework into your project.  Planned CocoaPods and Carthage support.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Docs</th>
<td>Gorgeous docs generated by AppleDoc.  Online tutorials and videos.</td>
<td>Gorgeous docs generated by Jazzy.  Playgrounds do a great job of replacing tutorials.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>License</th>
<td>MIT License, but you need to use the dynamic library.</td>
<td>MIT License. Period.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Examples</th>
<td>Included examples for iOS, OSX, and tvOS, plus a repository of example projects.</td>
<td>None yet, but perhaps this is an opportunity for you to contribute!</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Templates</th>
<td>Xcode templates for common classes.</td>
<td>No templates.  While we're able to write them, they are not too high on our priorit list, so we'll include the task of creating templates to the first-timers list.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Tests</th>
<td>Extremely well tested and under Travis CI.</td>
<td>Test infrastructure started, but not many tests written yet.  This is still very important to us and it is a high priority.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Sensible Defaults and Presets</th>
<td>Most operations have sensible defaults and presets.</td>
<td>Defaults, yes.  Presets not so much.  But they are not off the radard and they will be added.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Stability</th>
<td>This code has been stable for a while and is powering apps in the Apple Store.</td>
<td>Beta software.  It's called bleeding edge for a reason.</td>
</tr>
