<p>We're passionate about our tests because they allow us to build upon our code without worrying that we'll break anything along the way!</p>

<h3>Continuous Integration</h3>

<p>We've recently synced the AudioKit GitHub repository with <a href="https://travis-ci.org">TravisCI</a>.  Travis ensures that the test suite is run and that included examples compile on a fresh system.  We also happen to run a test on this web site with TravisCI ensuring we have no broken links.  Next on our list is to add Travis to the examples repository.</p>

<p>Current Build Status:</p>
<ul class="iconlist">
<li><i class="icon-line-play"></i> AudioKit Develop Branch: <a href="https://travis-ci.org/audiokit/AudioKit"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/audiokit/AudioKit.svg?branch=develop"></a></li>
<li><i class="icon-line-play"></i> AudioKit Web Site: <a href="https://travis-ci.org/audiokit/audiokit.github.io"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/audiokit/audiokit.github.io.svg?branch=master"></a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Command Line Tests</h3>

<p>You can run our tests from the command line to not only test a particular operation, but also to very quickly hear what something sounds like without building a project or running a playground.</p>

<p>Here is a video describing the tests and running the entire test suite as of the latest version of AudioKit.</p>
