<p>AudioKit 3 Comes with a few examples in the Examples directory.  They are separated by subfolders for each OS: iOS, OSX, and tvOS. </p>

<p>Each OS contains at least the Hello World project which just demonstrates using AudioKit to quickly add a sine wave generator and plot to a single view application.</p>
