  This project demonstrates applying a chain of effects to an input aduio stream.  Audio can come from the user's
  iTunes library or a set of included sampled audio files. The effects include variable delay, a Moog Ladder filter,
  and reverb, but we are adding to that list regularly.

<p>Since this is a bit more complicated than a new user might want to see at first, it is not included in AudioKit's example folder, but instead offered as a separate repository on GitHub:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/audiokit/EffectsProcessorDemo">https://github.com/audiokit/EffectsProcessorDemo</a></p>
