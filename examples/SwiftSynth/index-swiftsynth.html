<ul>
<li>You can get a pure Sine wave by (1) turning the Osc Mix to the left (2) turning off VCO1 (3) Turning the FM up!</li>
<li>Use the morph knob between square and pulse for basic PWM control.</li>
<li>Not getting enough low-end for your liking? Turn down the Rez.</li>
<li>Use 2 saws and detune VCO2 for a shimmery vintage Polysynth sound. Slowly open the filter to your taste.</li>
<li>The reverse saw LFO (the last wave setting on the LFO) can simulate a basic voltage-controlled note repeat.</li>
<li>Keep dry/wet knobs under 50% for a more powerful sound.</li>
<li>Turn the ADSR Release down to zero and turn the echo on to hear how the echo taps fire.</li>
<li>You can follow me on twitter @goFecher for more tips & updates on Swift Synth and other projects.</li>

<h3>    Edit the code for even more fun!</h3>
<ul>

<li>The sub is set to a sine wave for a more powerful bass tone. You can change it to a square if you'd like the synth to have more of a vintage feel. You can also experiment between -12/-24 settings.</li>
<li>Try changing the preset knob bounds (minimum/maximum) in the SynthViewController to extremes to play a synth with wild settings!</li>
<li>Sub and FM are tracked to the keyboard. Try tracking them to VCO1 for a more accurate Analog synth effect. (i.e. If you detune VCO1, FM & Sub also detune).</li>
<li>Keep us posted on any apps you make with the code, weâ€™d love to hear from you!</li>
