<h3>Installing and Using Xcode Templates</h3>

<p>
Included within AudioKit are Xcode templates that will help you get started when creating AudioKit classes from scratch.  The templates are for Objective-C or Swift and include a "conductor" class for managing audio, an "instrument" class for designing instruments and their associated notes, and a "processor" class, which is a special case of an instrument that process audio created by other instruments.
</p>

<p>To install the templates, make sure you have the Xcode folder for user file templates and if not, create it:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
mkdir -p ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Then, copy the "Templates / File Templates / AudioKit" folder from your downloaded AudioKit repository (in this case, AudioKit was installed in ~/Developer)</p>

{% highlight bash %}
cp -r ~/Developer/AudioKit/Templates/File\ Templates/AudioKit ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Now, when you choose "File / New / File..." in Xcode, the templates will appear in an AudioKit section of the dialog box:</p>
