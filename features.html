<a name="#open_source"></a>
<h2>Open Source</h2>
<p>We made AudioKit open-source because we believe that clear, powerful audio development is best developed and maintained through a large, active base of developers and users. If you’re interested in contributing more to the core of AudioKit, please get in touch (audiokit@audiokit.io).
</p>

<a name="#named_parameters"></a>
<h2>Named Parameters</h2>
<p>
We value clarity and beauty in code, which is why AudioKit utilizes named parameters. In AudioKit, the creation and initialization of an FM oscillator would look like the code below:
</p>

{% highlight objective-c %}
AKFMOscillator *fmOscil;
fmOscil = [[AKFMOscillator alloc] initWithFTable:sineTable
                                   baseFrequency:akp(440)
                               carrierMultiplier:akp(1)
                            modulatingMultiplier:akp(1)
                                 modulationIndex:akp(1)
                                       amplitude:akp(1)
                                           phase:akp(0)];
[self connect:fmOscil];
{% endhighlight %}


<p>Audio environments such as Csound, however, don’t utilize named parameters. As a result, the code is often unclear and difficult to understand at a first glance. For comparison, below is what the code for an FM oscillator in Csound would look like:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
asig foscili 1, 440, 1, 1, 1, 0
{% endhighlight %}

<a name="sensible_defaults"></a>
<h2>Sensible Defaults</h2>
<p>With AudioKit 1.1, we’ve started rolling out what we call “Sensible Defaults”. Sensible defaults allow you to create an AudioKit object without having to guess what initial values are appropriate—when you create an object, the parameter values will automatically be set to values that make sense. Of course, just as before, you can specify the value of all parameters in the init function, or use the defaults and change the values using properties.
</p>

<p>Below is what an instance of AKSleighbells, a physical modelling object; looks like using Sensible Defaults:</p>

{% highlight objective-c %}
AKSleighbells *sleighBells = [AKSleighbells audio];
[self connect:sleighBells];
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Previously, you would have had to set all of these values in the init function as shown below:</p>

{% highlight objective-c %}
AKSleighbells *sleighBells = [[AKSleighbells alloc]initWithIntensity:akp(32)
                                                       dampingFactor:akp(0.2)
                                               mainResonantFrequency:akp(2500)
                                              firstResonantFrequency:akp(5300)
                                             secondResonantFrequency:akp(6500)];
[self connect:sleighBells];
{% endhighlight %}

<a name="operations"></a>
<h2>100+ Operations</h2>
<p>AudioKit has over 100 operations, including oscillators, physical models, reverbs, filters, synthesizers, samplers, and many more to come. </p>

<a name="easy_installation"></a>
<h2>Easy Installation</h2>
<p>We’ve worked to make it very easy to get AudioKit installed in your Xcode project and start using it right-away. To this end, we’ve also made several file templates for both Objective-C and Swift: a conductor template, an instrument template, and a processor template.
</p>

<a name="sequences"></a>
<h2>Powerful Sequences and Phrases</h2>
<p>One of the most powerful features of AudioKit are sequences and phrases; two different ways to generate events. Sequences let you pass blocks of code as events. For example, you could pass in a block of sensor data that when received will change the parameters of an instrument.
</p>

<p>A musical phrase is series of sequential notes. In AudioKit, we implement this metaphor to allow instruments to play a series of defined notes whenever a phrase is called.
</p>

<a name="integration"></a>
<h2>Integrated Development</h2>
<p>High-level audio programming is often done in a complete separate environment from general application programming. With AudioKit, your audio programming is done in the same language that your application is written in. You only need one program and one language for both audio and app logic implementation. 
</p>

<a name="documentation"></a>
<h2>Clear Documentation</h2>
<p> <a href="/tutorials/xcode">Xcode documentation</a> is also available, so you can easily access information about AudioKit classes while you’re still in Xcode. And, since you’re using AudioKit directly within Xcode, you get all the benefits of code-completion.
</p>

<a name="examples"></a>
<h2>Many Examples</h2>
<p>We’ve made many <a href="/examples/">examples</a> for Mac and iOS platforms in Objective-C and Swift so that you can get started using AudioKit right away. Additionally, we have many tutorials <a href="/tutorials">tutorials</a> to help you get started as well.
</p>

<a name="tests"></a>
<h2>Heavily Tested</h2>
<p>Finally, we’ve added our previously internal tests to the <a href="https://github.com/audiokit/AudioKit">public repository</a>, and will be adding more as we finish them. In the short-term feature, we’re going to be working to expand sensible defaults to every available AudioKit object.
</p>

<a name="utilities"></a>
<h2>High-level Utilities</h2>
<p>AudioKit includes several built-in, high-level utilities. Right now, these are a sampler, pitch-tracker, and a level meter. We'll be including more soon.
</p>

<a name="community"></a>
<h2>Community Driven</h2>
<p>We actively encourage involvement from the open-source community. Our core code, tests, examples, and website are all available for contributions. We also have a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/audiokit">Google group</a>, and you can follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/AudioKitMan">Twitter!</a>
