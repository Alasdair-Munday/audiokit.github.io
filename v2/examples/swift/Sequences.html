<p>This example is part of the <a href="https://github.com/audiokit/Examples">AudioKit Examples</a> GitHub repository.</p>

<p>
"Sequences" demonstrates three methods of creating a series of notes: creating a separate note in the sequence, altering note properties, and updating instrument properties.

<p>
The code below (from 'SequencesConductor.swift') will control the phrases the instrument plays by changing the values of the instrument's notes.
</p>

{% highlight swift %}
func playPhraseOfNotesOfDuration(duration: Float) {

    let phrase = AKPhrase()

    for i in 0...12 {
        let note = SeqInstrumentNote()
        note.frequency.floatValue = 440*(pow(2.0,Float(i)/12))
        note.duration.value = duration

        let time = duration * Float(i)
        phrase.addNote(note, atTime: time)
    }

    instrument.playPhrase(phrase)
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
The code below, also from 'SequencesConductor.swift', performs the same task as the previous function, but in a different way. This function creates a series of note-on events in a sequence, which is then played by the instrument.  Sequences are more powerful than events because any code can be executed in a sequence, while a phrase can only includes notes.
</p>

{% highlight swift %}
func playSequenceOfNotePropertiesOfDuration(duration: Float) {

    let note = SeqInstrumentNote(frequency: 440)

    for i in 0...12 {
        let update = AKEvent() {
            note.frequency.floatValue = 440*(pow(2.0,Float(i)/12))
        }

        let time = duration * Float(i)
        sequence.addEvent(update, atTime: time)
    }

    let stopNote = AKEvent() { note.stop() }
    sequence.addEvent(stopNote, atTime: duration * 13)

    instrument.playNote(note)
    sequence.play()
}
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
Additionally, this example project shows how sequences can be used to change the properties of an instrument, in this case, the modulation value of the FMOscillator.
