<h3>Just a little more configuration for Swift...</h3>
<p>
Follow the configuration instructions for an Objective-C project and then there will be one additional step we need to make in order to use AudioKit in our Swift project. One of the great things about Swift is that we're able to easily use Objective-C code in Swift projects. The steps required are just to set up a bridging header and copy the <code>AudioKit.swift</code> file into your project.  The following video will walk you through it.

Now that our Swift project is able to "see" AudioKit, we can go ahead and start making our first instrument in Swift!"
