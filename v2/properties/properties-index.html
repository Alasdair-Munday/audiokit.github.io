<p>Properties come in two flavors, <a href="/v2/Classes/AKInstrumentProperty/">AKInstrumentProperty</a> for instruments and <a href="/v2/Classes/AKNoteProperty/">AKNoteProperty</a> for notes. Both kinds of properties can control anything about an instrument, the primary difference is that changing an instrument property will change the sounds of all sounds being created by an instrument whereas adjusting a note property only affects that occurrence of the sound. A good example of the difference might be if you are describing a guitar instrument, an instrument property could be the body resonance or tone control, but the frequency would be a note property since a guitar can play six individual frequencies as six notes for each string.</p>

<h3>Sliders and Labels</h3>

<p>AudioKit includes two UI classes very helpful for building interfaces to instrument properties: <a href="/v2/Classes/AKPropertySlider/">AKPropertySlider</a> and <a href="/v2/Classes/AKPropertyLabel/">AKPropertyLabel</a>.

<p>For example, if you have a pitch property for an instrument, you create a slider and a label in Interface Builder, change their types to <code>AKSlider</code> and <code>AKLabel</code> and inside the interface (or implementation) file:

{% highlight objective-c %}
IBOutlet AKPropertySlider *pitchSlider;
IBOutlet AKPropertyLabel  *pitchLabel;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Then, you only need to associate the user interface elements with the instrument property as follows:</p>

{% highlight objective-c %}
pitchSlider.property = instrument.pitch;
pitchLabel.property  = instrument.pitch;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now, any changes to the instrument property "pitch" gets immediately reflected on either the slider or the label.  For the slider, the maximum and minimum are derived from the property's maximum and minimum values.</p>

<p>The included "AudioKitDemo" project and many of the projects in the AudioKit Examples repository use this technique, so you can see these classes in action there.</p>
