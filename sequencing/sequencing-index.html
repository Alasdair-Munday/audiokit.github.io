<p>There are two powerful sequencing systems available in AudioKit: <strong>note phrases</strong> and <strong>event sequences</strong>.  The difference betweeen the two is that phrases are currently limited to playing notes, whereas sequences trigger events that can be notes or any other code that you like.  Phrases are precise and fast, and suitable for a certain class of tasks (such as musical events).  While sequences are extremely general, timing is limited to the accuracy of Apple's scheduling system.</p>

<h3>Note Phrases</h3>

<p>Phrases are able to play notes at specific times relative to the phrase start time. </p>

<h3>Event Sequences</h3>

<p>Sequences are able to play events at specific times relative to the sequence start time.</p>
