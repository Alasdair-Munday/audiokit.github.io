<p>There are two powerful sequencing systems available in AudioKit: <strong>note phrases</strong> and <strong>event sequences</strong>.  The difference between the two is that phrases are currently limited to playing notes, whereas sequences trigger events that can be notes or any other code that you like.  Phrases are precise and fast, and suitable for a certain class of tasks (such as musical events).  While sequences are extremely general, timing is limited to the accuracy of Apple's scheduling system.</p>

<h3>Example Projects</h3>

<p>There are two Sequencing Example Projects, one in  <a href="/examples/Sequences/">Objective-C</a> and second in <a href="/examples/swift/Sequences/">Swift</a>, both available in the AudioKit Examples repository. It covers three different ways to create a stream of notes. </p>

<h3>Note Phrases</h3>

<p>Phrases are collections of notes at specific times relative to the phrase start time. </p>
<p>To create a phrase, start with an empty phrase</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
AKPhrase *phrase = [AKPhrase phrase];
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Then create a note (either an AKNote or a subclass of AKNote)</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
YourInstrumentNote *note = [[YourInstrumentNote alloc] init];
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Set whatever properties either in an initializer, or by directly accessing them:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
note.frequency.value = 440;
note.duration.value = 1;
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
And then add the note to the phrase either right after the last note (or if the phrase empty, at the beginning) or after a delay:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
[phrase addNote:note atTime:1.0];
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Repeat this note creation process until your phrase is done and then play the phrase on your instrument:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
[yourInstrument playPhrase:phrase];
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="col_half nobottommargin col_last">
<h3>Event Sequences</h3>

<p>Sequences are able to play events at specific times relative to the sequence start time.</p>
<p>To create a sequence, start with an empty sequence</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
AKSequence *sequence = [AKSequence sequence];
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Then create AKEvents to add to the sequence:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
AKEvent *yourEvent = [[AKEvent alloc] initWithBlock:^{

    // Put any code in here, could be
    // note or instrument manipulation
    yourInstrument.frequency.value = 440;

    // or even non-audio related code:
    NSLog(@"I am also logging during the sequence!");
}];
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Then add the event to the sequence:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
[sequence addEvent:yourEvent atTime:1.0];
{% endhighlight %}

<p>And finally, after adding whatever other events you want, play the sequence:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
[sequence play];
{% endhighlight %}
