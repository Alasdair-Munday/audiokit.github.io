<p><h3>AKBitCrusher
</h3><h4>An audio signal consists of two components, amplitude and frequency. When an analog audio signal is converted to a digial representation, these two components are stored by a bit-depth value, and a sample-rate value. The sample-rate represents the number of samples of audio per second, and the bit-depth represents the number of bits used capture that audio. The bit-depth specifies the dynamic range (the difference between the smallest and loudest audio signal). By changing the bit-depth of an audio file, you can create rather interesting digital distortion effects.<br>
