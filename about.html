<p>I am the primary programmer of Audio Kit and I maintain its code base and this web site.  I co-founded the company, Hear For Yourself, with Adam to support enterprise applications using Audio Kit.  Adam and I are both available for consulting, training, or sound design, so feel free to contact us.</p>

Adam is co-founder of Hear For Yourself and has a long history in computer audio.  As an entrepreneur, he develops new technologies to demonstrate how cognitive data can be mined from the auditory experiences of everyday life and conversely, how audio experience can be driven by data.
