<h2>Audio Kit Toolkit including example projects</h2>

<p>We include a variety of sample projects alongside the toolkit so that you can get started right away.  Here's how to get the complete package:</p>

Installing from command line (defaults to "develop" branch):
<p><code>
> git clone git@github.com:audiokit/AudioKit.git
</code></p>
Archives are available:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/audiokit/AudioKit/archive/master.zip">Master Branch (19.5MB zip)</a> - most stable </li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/audiokit/AudioKit/archive/develop.zip">Development Branch (19.5MB zip)</a> - latest and greatest </li>
</ul>

<h2>Audio Kit DocSet</h2>

<p>Code completion, pop-ups, and sidebar information are automatically created in Xcode, but if you would like Apple-style API reference documentation, install the docset:</p>

<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/fzi7jpbnkg8md6o/com.hearforyourself.AudioKit.docset.zip?dl=0">com.hearforyourself.AudioKit.docset.zip</a>
<br>
(To install, unzip and place the resulting docset in your <code>~/Library/Developer/Shared/Documentation/DocSets/</code> folder.)
