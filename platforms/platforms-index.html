<p>AudioKit works on iOS mobile devices and OSX computers.  It is written in Objective-C but you can easily use it from a Swift-based app or application as well.</p>

<p>If you are installing AudioKit by dragging the AudioKit folder into your project, the next step you will usually do is to open the "Platforms" subfolder in Xcode and removing the platform-specific files that you do not need.</p>
